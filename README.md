# BasicAML - A Simple BASIC Interpreter in OCaml

BasicAML is a minimalist interpreter for a subset of the BASIC programming language, implemented in OCaml. It supports basic commands such as variable assignment, printing, conditional jumps, and program termination.

This project is intended for educational purposes, demonstrating how to build a simple interpreter using lexical analysis and parsing techniques.

Future enhancements may include adding more language features, improving error handling, and reading programs from external files.
