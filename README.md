## Introduction
BasicAML is a minimalist interpreter for a subset of the BASIC programming language, implemented in OCaml. It supports basic commands such as variable assignment, printing, conditional jumps, and program termination.


## Objectives
This project is intended for educational purposes, demonstrating how to build a simple interpreter using lexical analysis and parsing techniques.

## Future Work
Future enhancements may include adding more language features, improving error handling, and reading programs from external files.
